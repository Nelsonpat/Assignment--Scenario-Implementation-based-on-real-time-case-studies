Instruction

**Mallwart Online Store Azure Infrastructure Enhancement**

**Problem Statement (Scenario):**

In the ever-evolving landscape of modern business, harnessing cloud technology has become indispensable, offering unparalleled flexibility and cost-effectiveness. However, as organizations embrace platforms like Azure, the challenge of optimizing resource utilization while ensuring security and operational efficiency becomes paramount. 

Mallwart, an established retail giant, is venturing into the online realm by launching its e-commerce platform. To ensure a seamless and secure online shopping experience, Mallwart has chosen Microsoft Azure as its cloud platform. Your task is to design and implement an efficient online store infrastructure using Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), emphasizing security, scalability, and automation.

This project addresses the need to enhance Mallwart's online store infrastructure by leveraging Azure cloud services. The objective is to establish a secure, scalable, and automated architecture that accommodates the web server, application server, and database server components. 

The project further aims to implement robust network security practices through Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Virtual Networks (VNets), while streamlining resource management using PowerShell scripting for seamless operations.

**Objectives:**

The objective of this project is to enhance Mallwart's online store by leveraging Azure cloud services to establish a secure, scalable, and automated infrastructure. Key goals include:

- Set up Azure VMs to effectively host the vital components of the online store, namely the web server, application server, and database server.
- Integrate robust security practices by deploying Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Virtual Networks (VNets) to safeguard the online store's infrastructure from potential threats.
- Develop efficient PowerShell scripts to facilitate the automated deployment, configuration, and ongoing management of Azure resources, ensuring consistent and streamlined operations.

**Your focus in this project should be on the following:**

- Learn to set up different parts of the online store on Azure VMs, like the web server, app server, and database server. Understand how to choose the right settings for best performance.
- Understand how to protect the online store using tools like Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Virtual Networks (VNets). Keep bad traffic out and the store safe.
- Practice using PowerShell to make tasks easier. Create scripts that set up everything automatically, like installing software and configuring security.
- See how the web, app, and database servers work together in Azure. Learn how they make the online store work well.
- Understand how what you're learning applies to real businesses. See the importance of safe, scalable, and automated setups.

**Deliverables**

- Detailed documentation elucidating the step-by-step process of configuring Azure VMs to host the online store components, including the web server, application server, and database server.
- A comprehensive guide showcasing the setup and configuration of Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Virtual Networks (VNets) to reinforce network security measures.
- A collection of PowerShell scripts tailored to automate resource deployment, configuration, and management tasks within the Azure environment.

**Tasks/Activities List**

- Configure Azure VMs to host the online store's web server, application server, and database server.
- Establish NSGs to enforce security policies for inbound and outbound traffic.
- Create VNets to isolate and organize the online store's infrastructure components.
- Develop PowerShell scripts for automated deployment of Azure resources.
- Utilize scripts to configure NSGs and define access control rules.
- Automate the installation of necessary software and services on VMs.
- Implement PowerShell scripts for initial database setup and schema creation.
- Develop scripts for regular database backups using Azure Backup.
- Craft PowerShell automation scripts to efficiently manage scalability based on usage metrics. 

**Success Metrics**

- Successfully configured Azure VMs to host the web server, application server, and database server components.
- Validate the effective implementation of NSGs and VNets, ensuring heightened network security.
- Demonstrate PowerShell scripts that facilitate seamless resource deployment, configuration, and ongoing management.

**Bonus Points**

- Consider exploring advanced concepts such as integration with Azure Monitor for enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities. Integrating Azure Policy for enforcing compliance and best practices could further elevate the project's value and scope.

**Submission Process**

- To showcase project completion, compile comprehensive documentation detailing the setup process, PowerShell scripts, and network security configurations. Include screenshots or videos demonstrating successful resource deployment, configuration, and network security measures.
